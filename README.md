# Scroller

Scroller is a MacOS accessibility app which allows you to scroll with one finger.
This is useful if you're using a stylus to control your trackpad.

Steps to get it working:
1. Download `Scroller.zip` from the Releases page here on Github.
2. Unzip the file
3. Right click the app and click Open
4. Click Open again
5. The first time you get it running, you will get a popup that it doesn't have accessibility permissions
6. Enable accessibility permissions
7. Open the app again and it will work.
8. Hold down the option key and move the trackpad to scroll.

If that doesn't work, you can build it from scratch like so:
1. Clone the repository and open the project in Xcode.
2. Build the app locally with âŒ˜-B.
3. The compiled app will be in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Scroller-.../Build/Products/Debug` where `...` is a long string of characters.
4. Run the app and you will get a popup that it doesn't have permissions.
5. Accept the permissions in the popup.
6. Run the app again and it will work.
7. Hold down the option key and move the trackpad to scroll.

All the code is in `AppDelegate.swift` and it is very simple (only 60 lines long).
You can also change the constants in `AppDelegate.swift` to whatever configuration you want.
This allows you to change the speed of the scrolling (`SCROLL_SPEED`) and which key triggers the scrolling (`SCROLL_FLAG`).

Contributions are welcome!
